# Contributing to Substrate's Docs

Thanks you for helping us improve our documentation. Contributions to this project will be live on [https://docs.substrate.run](https://docs.substrate.run) upon merge.

## Contributor’s Guide

Most of our docs are written in Markdown. If you are not familiar with Markdown, learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Docs content can be found in the `pages` folder. Each subdirectory within `pages` contains a `_meta.json` file mapping docs titles to their corresponding markdown files.

Direct contributions are much appreciated for simple things (corrections, small additions to existing content). If the change is more complex, we encourage you to start a discussion in GitHub Issues or our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/substratecommunity/shared_invite/zt-2jd8w6b7n-b0qE5QWV7rsClGglHeu_rA).


## Making changes

Once you located the file that you want to update, click on “Edit” which will create a new forked repo. You can make your edits there, and submit a PR. Alternatively, you can manually fork the repo, create a branch in your fork and make all the edits you want before submitting a PR.

Once we review it, we’ll likely provide feedback and might ask you for improvements. We aim to provide a meaningful response to all PRs and issues from external contributors within 5 business days.

You can optionally [run the application locally](https://github.com/graphprotocol/docs/blob/main/README.md) to review your changes.
