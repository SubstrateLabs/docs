Substrate accesses your Amazon S3 buckets using credentials that you provide. You can register these credentials with Substrate in the [Dashboard](https://www.substrate.run/dashboard/external-files).
Substrate securely stores your credentials and uses them to access your S3 buckets when you schedule a graph run.

## 1. Register AWS Credentials

There are two ways you can register AWS credentials with Substrate: a [Cross Account Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html) or an [Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

### Cross Account Role

Cross-account roles are the recommended way to provide secure access to your AWS resources.

You can configure a cross-account role for Substrate with the following steps:

1. Navigate to [External Files](https://www.substrate.run/dashboard/external-files) in the Substrate Dashboard. Create a new Credential and select **Cross-account role** as the credential type.
2. Provide a unique display name for the credential and take note of the **AWS Account ID** and the **External ID** displayed near the bottom of the form.
3. Visit the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/), navigate to **IAM** and then **Roles**.
4. Click **Create Role**. Under **Trusted entity type**, choose **AWS account**. Select **Another AWS account** and click _Require external ID_.
5. Enter the **AWS Account ID** and **External ID** that you copied from the Substrate Dashboard and click next.
6. Then, on the Add Permissions screen, attach permissions to the role. Click next and enter a name and description for the role. You should see a trust policy similar to this:

<CH.Code className="aws-ch-json-blob">

```json focus=7:14
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "018062818227"
      },
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "<YOUR_EXTERNAL_ID>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</CH.Code>

6. After creating the cross-account role, copy its **ARN** and paste it into the Substrate Dashboard.
7. You can optionally use the **Test Credentials** button in the Substrate Dashboard to verify that the role has been set up correctly.
8. Click **Create** to save the credentials.

### Access Key

The Access Key credential type allows you to grant Substrate access to an IAM user by providing one of the user's Access Key ID and Secret Access Key combinations.

For help generating these keys, check out the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

Once you have an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key:

1. Navigate to [External Files](https://www.substrate.run/dashboard/external-files) in the Substrate Dashboard. Create a new Credential and select **Access Key** as the credential type.
2. Enter a unique display name for the credential and paste in the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
3. You can optionally use the **Test Credentials** button in the Substrate Dashboard to verify that the access key has been set up correctly.
4. Click **Create** to save the credentials.

## 2. Create File Store

To register an S3 bucket with Substrate, navigate to [External Files](https://www.substrate.run/dashboard/external-files) in the Substrate Dashboard. Create a new Connection.

Next, enter the details of the S3 bucket you want to register.
You will need to know the name of your S3 bucket and the AWS Region it's located in.
You can access information about your S3 buckets in the [AWS Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home).
