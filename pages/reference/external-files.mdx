Substrate nodes can read from and write to your own external file storage. Currently, Substrate supports connections to [Amazon S3](/external-files/s3).

You can manage external file storage connections in the [Substrate Dashboard](https://www.substrate.run/dashboard/external-files).

### S3 Inputs

You can use S3 URIs as inputs to nodes. For example, if you have an audio file stored in an S3 bucket named `my-bucket` and want to use it as an input to <TranscribeSpeech/>,
you can set `audio_uri` to `s3://my-bucket/<filename>`.

<CH.Code>

```python Python
transcribe = TranscribeSpeech(audio_uri="s3://my-bucket/input.wav")
```

```typescript TypeScript
const transcribe = new TranscribeSpeech({
  audio_uri: "s3://my-bucket/input.wav",
});
```

</CH.Code>

### S3 Outputs

You can write outputs to S3 URIs from nodes. For example, if you've linked an S3 bucket named `my-bucket` and want to write an output to that bucket, you can set the `store` parameter to `s3://my-bucket/<filename>`.

<CH.Code>

```python Python
image = GenerateImage(
    prompt="oil painting",
    # mark
    store="s3://my-bucket/output.jpeg"
)
```

```typescript TypeScript
const image = new GenerateImage({
  prompt: "oil painting",
  // mark
  store: "s3://my-bucket/output.jpeg",
});
```

</CH.Code>
