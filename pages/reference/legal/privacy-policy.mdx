### Sharing information with third parties
The personal information Substrate Labs collects from you is stored in one or more databases hosted by third parties located in the United States. These third parties do not use or have access to your personal information for any purpose other than cloud storage and retrieval. On occasion, Substrate Labs engages third parties to send information to you, including information about our products, services, and events.

We do not otherwise reveal your personal data to non-Substrate Labs persons or businesses for their independent use unless: (1) you request or authorize it; (2) it's in connection with Substrate Labs-hosted and Substrate Labs co-sponsored conferences as described above; (3) the information is provided to comply with the law (for example, compelled by law enforcement to comply with a search warrant, subpoena, or court order), enforce an agreement we have with you, or to protect our rights, property or safety, or the rights, property or safety of our employees or others; (4) the information is provided to our agents, vendors or service providers who perform functions on our behalf; (5) to address emergencies or acts of God; or (6) to address disputes, claims, or to persons demonstrating legal authority to act on your behalf. We may also gather aggregated data about our services and website visitors and disclose the results of such aggregated (but not personally identifiable) information to our partners, service providers, advertisers, and/or other third parties for marketing or promotional purposes.
The Substrate Labs website connects with third party services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter and others. If you choose to share information from the Substrate Labs website through these services, you should review the privacy policy of that service. If you are a member of a third party service, the aforementioned connections may allow that service to connect your visit to our site to your personal data.

### Transferring personal data to the U.S.
Substrate Labs has its headquarters in the United States. Information we collect about you will be processed in the United States. By using Substrate Labs services, you acknowledge that your personal information will be processed in the United States. The United States has not sought nor received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the GDPR. Pursuant to Article 46 of the GDPR, Substrate Labs is providing for appropriate safeguards by entering binding, standard data protection clauses, enforceable by data subjects in the EEA and the UK. These clauses have been enhanced based on the guidance of the European Data Protection Board and will be updated when the new draft model clauses are approved.
Depending on the circumstance, Substrate Labs also collects and transfers to the U.S. personal data with consent; to perform a contract with you; or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of Substrate Labs in a manner that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. Substrate Labs endeavors to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your personal data and to use it only consistent with your relationship with Substrate Labs and the practices described in this Privacy Statement. Substrate Labs also enters into data processing agreements and model clauses with its vendors whenever feasible and appropriate. Since it was founded, Substrate Labs has received zero government requests for information.

When technically feasible, Substrate Labs will—at your request—provide your personal data to you.
Reasonable access to your personal data will be provided at no cost. If access cannot be provided within a reasonable time frame, Substrate Labs will provide you with a date when the information will be provided. If for some reason access is denied, Substrate Labs will provide an explanation as to why access has been denied.
