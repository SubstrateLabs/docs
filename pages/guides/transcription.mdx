<Callout emoji="֍">Learn how to transcribe audio and video</Callout>

The <TranscribeSpeech/> node transcribes speech from audio or video input, with additional built-in capabilities:

- segmentation by sentence
- diarization (speaker identification)
- alignment to word-level timestamps
- automatic chapter detection

To simply transcribe input without further processing, provide an _`audio_uri`_. This can be a publicly-hosted audio or video file, base-64-encoded audio or video data, or a privately-hosted [external file](http://localhost:3000/reference/external-files). For best results, you may also provide a _`prompt`_ that describes the content of the audio or video.

<CH.Code>

```python Python
from substrate import Substrate, TranscribeSpeech

# ...

transcript = TranscribeSpeech(
    audio_uri="https://media.substrate.run/dfw-clip.m4a",
    prompt="David Foster Wallace interviewed about US culture",
)
res = substrate.run(transcript)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Substrate, TranscribeSpeech } from "substrate";

// ...

const transcript = new TranscribeSpeech({
  audio_uri: "https://media.substrate.run/dfw-clip.m4a",
  prompt: "David Foster Wallace interviewed about US culture",
});
const res = await substrate.run(transcript);
```

To enable additional capabilities, set:

<CH.Section>

- _`segment: True`_ to return a list of sentence _`segments`_ with _`start`_ and _`end`_ timestamps.
- _`align: True`_ to return a list of aligned _`words`_ within sentence _`segments`_.
- _`diarize: True`_ to include _`speaker`_ IDs within _`segments`_ and _`words`_.
- _`suggest_chapters: True`_ to return a list of suggested _`chapters`_ with titles and _`start`_ timestamps.

<CH.Code>

```python Python
transcript = TranscribeSpeech(
