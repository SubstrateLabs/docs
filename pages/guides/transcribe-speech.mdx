The <TranscribeSpeech/> node transcribes speech from audio or video files. Supported input types include:

- Base-64 encoded data strings (if your media is small enough to fit in a request payload). Be sure to include the `data:` prefix with a [mime type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types).
- Hosted media URLs (with a wide range of supported formats)
- YouTube URLs

`TranscribeSpeech` also includes these built-in capabilities:

- segmentation by sentence
- diarization (speaker identification)
- alignment to word-level timestamps
- automatic chapter detection

To simply transcribe input without further processing, provide an _`audio_uri`_. This can be a publicly-hosted audio or video file, base-64-encoded audio or video data, or a privately-hosted [external file](http://localhost:3000/reference/external-files). For best results, you may also provide a _`prompt`_ that describes the content of the audio or video.

<CH.Code>

```python Python
from substrate import Substrate, TranscribeSpeech

# ...

transcript = TranscribeSpeech(
    audio_uri="https://media.substrate.run/dfw-clip.m4a",
    prompt="David Foster Wallace interviewed about US culture",
)
res = substrate.run(transcript)
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { Substrate, TranscribeSpeech } from "substrate";

// ...

const transcript = new TranscribeSpeech({
  audio_uri: "https://media.substrate.run/dfw-clip.m4a",
  prompt: "David Foster Wallace interviewed about US culture",
});
const res = await substrate.run(transcript);
```

</CH.Code>

<details>
<summary>Output</summary>

```json
{
  "text": "language like that, the wounded inner child, the inner pain, is part of a kind of pop psychological movement in the United States that is a sort of popular Freudianism that ..."
}
```

</details>

To enable additional capabilities, set:

<CH.Section>

- _`segment: True`_ to return a list of sentence _`segments`_ with _`start`_ and _`end`_ timestamps.
- _`align: True`_ to return a list of aligned _`words`_ within sentence _`segments`_.
- _`diarize: True`_ to include _`speaker`_ IDs within _`segments`_ and _`words`_.
- _`suggest_chapters: True`_ to return a list of suggested _`chapters`_ with titles and _`start`_ timestamps.

<CH.Code>

```python Python
transcript = TranscribeSpeech(
    audio_uri="https://media.substrate.run/dfw-clip.m4a",
    prompt="David Foster Wallace interviewed about US culture",
    segment=True,
    align=True,

You can customize the chapter summarization feature by implementing your own pipeline. To learn how to do this, and see example of how to use text segments to create an animated captions experience, check out our runnable [example on val.town](https://www.val.town/v/substrate/subaudio). You can also find this example in the `examples/descript` directory of the [substrate-python](https://github.com/substratelabs/substrate-python) and [substrate-typescript](https://github.com/substratelabs/substrate-typescript) SDK repositories.
