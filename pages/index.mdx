Substrate is a **powerful SDK** for building with AI models, with [batteries included](https://substrate.run/nodes): language models, image generation, built-in vector storage, sandboxed code execution, and more.

Substrate is also an **inference engine optimized for running compound AI workloads**. Wiring together multiple inference APIs is inherently slow â€“ whether you do it yourself, or use a framework like LangChain. Substrate lets you ditch the framework, write less code, and run compound AI fast. Learn more: [Why Substrate?](/why)

### Mini examples

Substrate is the **simplest** way to write multi-step AI programs. Each example below is hosted in a runnable code environment, so you can get a feel for Substrate without opening your editor.

Take a JSON object and transform it into the target schema. <ComputeJSON /> produces 100% guaranteed JSON output. (Unreliable JSON generation is a common pain point with other providers.)

Describe an image with <ComputeText />, generate the image with <GenerateImage />, and upscale it with <UpscaleImage />. Substrate is the most elegant way to chain multiple models.

Search Hacker News comments, extract sentiment and summarize with <ComputeJSON />, and generate a markdown report with <ComputeText />. The code is minimal, simply relating tasks to each other. Substrate automatically parallelizes dozens of JSON extraction tasks, and injects their results into the final summarization task.
